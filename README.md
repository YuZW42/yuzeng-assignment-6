I moved the entire file to this repo, the actual implementation can be found using this path: Assignment-6-Linear-Regression-/starter_code/app.py

I tried testing my microphone but the result came out unideal. I am going to try other methods in future assignments, but I am going to list out some of my observation here. 

As N increases, the distribution is more equally distributed like a bell curve. As variance increases, the data points became more scattered, as reflected in the more spread out y-axises. This will increase the chances that we make a less accurate estimate. The small sample size had a sharp increase as illstrated in the demo, versus the larger sample size that is a lot more flat. This suggest that variance and sample size can both have an effect on how accurate the model is, and after doing some testing, having more samples with the expense of high variance might not increase the accuracy of the model. 

This is another example of N = 100, Mean = 1, Variance = 200, and 1000 simulations
